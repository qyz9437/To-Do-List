This app will allow users to:

    Add tasks
    Mark tasks as completed
    Delete tasks
    (Optional) Save tasks locally to persist data on page reload

Key Features

    HTML: Structure the basic layout â€“ a title, an input box to add new tasks, an "Add" button, and a list area to display the tasks.

    CSS: Style the app with a clean look. You could add some hover effects or make completed tasks look visually distinct (like adding a strikethrough).

    JavaScript:
        Create functions to add a new task, mark a task as completed, and delete a task.
        Use an array to store the list of tasks.
        Use event listeners to handle button clicks and task interactions.

Optional Features (for more practice)

    Local Storage: Use localStorage to save the list of tasks so they stay on the page even after refreshing or closing the browser.

    Date Sorting: Add timestamps to tasks and sort them by date or priority.

    Drag-and-Drop: Allow users to reorder tasks by dragging and dropping.

    Filtering/Searching: Add a filter to show only completed or incomplete tasks, or add a search bar.
